# Pixelate

Pixelate an image if you like that sort of aesthetic. Many options available including a gradient filter which pixelizes
the image more from left to right or vice-versa. The most prominent colours of the image are chosen using ColorThief (I
think it uses PCA to extract most relevant colours). An example is given below.
